# AmplificationAttacks

In the AmazonAmplification folder it demonstrates the attackers process in finding amplification attacks as well as an example of how an attackers script would work.

# What are DDoS attacks?
A DDoS attack is when a hacker or group of hackers launches an attack on a server that overflows it's network capacity. Since the victims' network is full of illegitimate connections, this means real connections from actual people will not be accepted. Imagine owning a restaurant, and you have a steady base of people who come in, order then leave. Your restaurant can only seat 100 people at a time. Now imagine that 5,000 people show up all at once but they don't want to eat, they just want to block the entrance and overwhelm your staff. Since your staff is overwhelmed, they can't take any orders from the real customers, otherwise denying them service. Although there are a few more moving parts, this is almost exactly what happens to servers when they undergo one of these attacks. There are 3 main methods of launching these attacks. These methods are using a Botnet(a network of infected devices), servers, or amplification attacks. The difference between those 3 are what it takes to create them, and the amount of traffic they are able to push. 

# Botnets - 
A botnet, the attacker needs to exploit into IOT devices to infect it. Attackers who find their own exploits are the ones who are able to profit the most and gain the most devices, however, the ones who own Botnets and only use exploits they found are the top 0.01% of hackers. The other 99.9% take the easy way out due to their lack of knowledge in exploitation and use publicly available exploits on places like [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/). The process these "hackers" follow is easy, even a child could understand: They run a program called [Zmap](https://github.com/zmap/zmap) to generate random IPs and check if they respond on a certain port, then after that they run the exploit (almost always a python file) with the arguments of the IP's they just scanned from ZMap. Since they're not creating/finding the exploit this requires no knowledge of exploitation, however, the devices are most likely being infected by other people as well. This method, for someone with no background in exploitation, is at a medium level, and also time-consuming.

# Servers -
A server is simple. The attacker will most likely look for a server that is offshore or wont ban them for launching DoS attacks and install scripts that send illegitimate traffic. Although this technically isn't a DoS, if an attacker gets access to a server with IP Header Modification, they're able to spoof the Source IP so on the victim's end it looks like they're getting attacked from multiple devices. This method is the least effective unless there are multiple servers, or if they're using carefully crafted packets to bypass firewalls.

# Amplification Attacks - 
Amplification attacks are very similar to both of the attacks listed above but with a special twist. Not only are they easy to set up, but they are able to amplify the amount of data the attackers port can push. For example, if the attacker is using some server with the port-speed of 1 gbit/sec, if they use an amplification attack of 500x, they would be pushing 500gbits/sec. This combined with how easy they are to set up makes amplification attacks not only dangerous, but also an attackers method of choice.

# How do Amplification attacks work?
Amplification attacks work by sending a small message to a legitimate unknowing server and then changing the return address to the victims IP address. For example, imagine you call a supermarket, and say "List me every single item you have in the store, but reach me at this number: *********" then hang up. That supermarket is now going to go call that number, and list every single item they have in the store. That is essentially the same thing that happens in an amplification attack. On the victims end, it doesn't look like they're getting attacked from the server itself, it looks like it's getting a bunch of information that they did not request.

# Additional Information - 
Amplification attacks can't just be ran on any server by an attacker trying to set them up. They reqiure something called IPHM (IP Header Modification) or what they like to call "Spoofed Servers". Since there is no legitimate use case for IPHM most servers have this option disabled to prevent people from using it for amplification attacks. Some server providers accidentally leave IPHM enabled, and others purposefully enable it. The ones that purposefully enable it know what they're doing, and market their servers as "Spoofed" and charge a higher more premium price even though the amount of hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) is really not worth it. For example, a 2-core, 4 GB RAM server at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#basic-droplets) is $24 a month, at a service that offers the exact same server with IPHM enabled it could be $40-$60 a month.
